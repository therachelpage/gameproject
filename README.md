Teams take turns coming up with various words to compete at making madlibs. Each team is given several prompts in which they get to choose these words at random. Each teams words are then arranged into a madlib and displayed on the screen. After both teams madlibs are displayed, a panel of judges vote for their favorite combination of words. The team with the most votes has the winning madlib and wins the game.
