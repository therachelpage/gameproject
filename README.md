<u>Madlib Wars - 1st Version</u> 

Teams take turns coming up with various words to compete at making madlibs. Each team is given several prompts in which they get to select words at random. Each teams words are then arranged via Javascript into a madlib and displayed on the screen. After both teams madlibs are displayed, two selected judges vote for their favorite combination of words based on the categories of originality, humor, and overall performance. Both teams can receive up to 3 votes for each category. The first team to reach 5 votes has has the winning madlib and wins the game.

In the future, this project will be remade so the prompts are replaced by a form that enables each team to fill out their words of choice.   Another version of the project will also be developed into a digital card game in which cards are created that contain various nouns, verbs, adjectives, cities, animals, body parts, etc. The users can randomly choose the digital cards that they see fit, creating a madlib that is then displayed on screen. Think Cards Against Humanity but for Madlibs, only digital. I would also like to create a version of this project in which people from all over the world are able to play Madlib Wars with each other online.
